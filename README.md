## Running the app

`yarn install && yarn start`

## Deployment

1. Deployed on heroku. My site is [here](https://formation-twitter-client.herokuapp.com/)

## My thoughts

1. What are your thoughts on this app?
   I do satisfy with this app which I have done just because I have never used Twitter api and have to read
   the documentation almost the whole day to get started.  
   With regards as a task, this app is pretty big since you cannot connect directly to Twitter api from frontend (Welp, at least I didn't know) and
   need to write a backend server.

2. I need to write the backend (no stress). But reading the documentation and setting up (because I don't use twitter) and finding resources (before I start writing backend) and getting started took my time. Another thing is I haven't touched graphql before.

3. In terms of frontend, I would do responsive design since it is not responsive enough. Then, I will add `Loading/Spinner` components to have solid user experience. And also, need to disable the form submit buttons as well as like and retweet buttons after the user has clicked not to make network requests a thousand times. Finally, need to do code cleaning a bit.

4. Next steps are to find the users and obviously authentication with Twitter Oauth since now I am using my keys to post and retweets. (I trust you guys ðŸ˜¬)

5. 7-8 hours for both backend and front end. Using postman to check if the backend works correctly.

6. Well, if you give the hints like `this task needs you to write a backend server`, that would have made my life easier. If you think that I don't need backend server, then I solved the problem with my own way ðŸ˜…. This is a cool app as well as a big task for the applicant since you need both restful and graphql.
